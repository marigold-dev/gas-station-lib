Toy example of a webapp using a gas station API and a permit contract. The webapp lets you mint a
NFT and transfer it to a “staking” contract even if you have no tez in your wallet.

The contracts are already deployed on Ghostnet. Their addresses, together with the API URL, can be
changed in the `.env` file.
